## Behaviour

### Pull Requests

When triggered against a pull request, will audit the change content for any
calls to GitHub actions/workflows that are not pinned to a SHA commit value.
This scans files changed in the pull request, and will NOT block merges
where GitHub actions elsewhere in the repository do not use SHA/commit values.

### Manual Invocation

Operates differently when explicitly called using "workflow_dispatch" trigger.
Will scan the entire repository for action/workflow calls and report results
for all GitHub actions/workflows found.
